# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing datasets to put my data skills into practice. Using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization, I explored trends, distributions, and correlations within the data.

The goal of this project was to apply my knowledge in a real-world scenario, transforming raw data into interpretable visual insights and strengthening my foundation in exploratory data analysis (EDA).
